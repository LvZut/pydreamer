changed obs to dict {'image' : obs}
changed episode length

added config parameters to info in obs
image channels depends on bev channels
number of workers corresponds to the number of carla instances


data.py error if prefill is too small








onehot encodings do not sum up to one, currently set manually in train.py (523)
fixed partially: obs dtype from uint8 to float, otherwise image gets scaled weirdly in preprocessing.py
problem is that background should also be a category
fixed by changing obs from carla env:
- only one category for each pixel
- additional layer (13 total after adding) for background (previous pixel was categoryless)


running with batch size/len == 1
